<h3>The Peripheral <br>
  <span class="year"> 2014</span>
</h3>
<p>
  Where Flynne and her brother, Burton, live, jobs outside the drug
business are rare. Fortunately, Burton has his veteran’s benefits, for
neural damage he suffered from implants during his time in the USMC’s
elite Haptic Recon force. Then one night Burton has to go out, but
there’s a job he’s supposed to do—a job Flynne didn’t know he had.
Beta-testing part of a new game, he tells her. The job seems to be
simple: work a perimeter around the image of a tower building. Little
buglike things turn up. He’s supposed to get in their way, edge them
back. That’s all there is to it. He’s offering Flynne a good price to 
take over for him. What she sees, though, isn’t what Burton told her
to expect. It might be a game, but it might also be murder.
